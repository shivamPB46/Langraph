🚀 Langagraph – Interactive Graph & Agent Simulation Tool

Langagraph is a fully interactive graph visualization & agent movement simulation tool built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no external frameworks required.
It allows users to generate graphs, create nodes & edges, visualize pathfinding, and watch agents move dynamically using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
